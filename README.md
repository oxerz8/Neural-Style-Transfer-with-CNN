# Neural-Style-Transfer-with-CNN

Given a set of content images and reference images, we use Convolutional Neural Networks model VGG-19 to perform Neural Style Transfer of the reference image onto the content image using Keras TensorFlow 

## Demonstration 

Given the following content image:

And an example reference style image:

We apply Neural Style Transfer techniques to transfer the artistic style of the reference image onto the content image to obtain the following result:
